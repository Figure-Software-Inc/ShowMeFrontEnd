# ShowMe Front-end Repository
This repository contains the React Native front-end framework portion of the mobile application ShoMe. The main directory
and app functioning contents will be stored in 'frontend.' On the other hand, we used Locofy to auto-generate certain 
components and assets, so it would make it easier when designing the functional portion of the app. The 'locofy' folder has
the image assets and appropriate CSS styling needed, so we would advise focusing on using this folder for reference to styles.

## Install/Setup Environment
Once you clone the repository onto your local IDE, please make sure you ```cd frontend``` to shift into the parent directory
for this project and avoid the ```locofy``` folder before running.

Run ```npm install``` to download the necessary external libraries we used for the project. Finally, run the project by typing ```npx expo start --tunnel```. We prefer ```--tunnel``` since it makes the development process easier and loads up the app faster with a proxy URL.
